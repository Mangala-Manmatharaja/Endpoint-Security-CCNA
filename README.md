## 📚 Project Ov

The goal of this lab is to **secure a wireless network** for a small business by configuring WPA2 Personal security on the 2.4 GHz band, updating client device settings, and verifying connectivity. This exercise reinforces practical skills in wireless configuration and endpoint security.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Verify initial network connectivity by accessing a web server (`www.cisco.pka`)
- 🔐 Configure a wireless router with **WPA2 Personal**, **AES encryption**, and a passphrase `Network123` for the **2.4 GHz** band
- 💻 Update laptop wireless settings to connect to the secured SSID: `Academy`
- 🌐 Validate connectivity post-configuration by accessing the web server
